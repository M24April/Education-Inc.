I was surfing pinterest and I found a post/picture and that picture is probably made by a vector graphics software, so I saw that Image and just imagined that I can make it with html and css, I just imagined it and started creating wireframing in my head.

I tried to make it and because I don't have all the knowledge of html and css yet so It was pretty difficult to align everything perfectly and make it look like the pinterest post and here I am finally made this project.

the fun thing is that after working hours on this project I forgot to do one thing, I forgot to save it so once I preview it and it didn't shows up in chrome so I thought maybe if I reopen this project in Acode then It might display in the browser and then I lost the file when I removed it from active files section so I have to make it again.

I hope you'll like it, thanks for your love and support â™¥
